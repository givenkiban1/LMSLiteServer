# LMSLiteServer
A Lite version of an LMS where students can access educational content/resources from this whatsapp chat bot and other fun stuff.

We took part in the DevSoc x DSC BreakTheRules Hackathon 2021 and we were tasked with creating a solution that solves one of the UN Sustainable development goals.

The SDG that we focused on is Quality Education.

The pandemic has affected the entire world and we've seen how much changed. Everything came to a stop. studying, working, etc.

Many priviliged schools were able to resume with their programme as they were able to setup or already had an LMS. Whilst many schools too were not able to
and this meant their students not being to study.

Our solution is a whatsapp bot which students can interact with to access educational content, take tests/quizzes and access useful tools.

Features:
1. Access past papers
2. Access University information (prospectus, closing dates, bursaries)
3. Learn (Access educational content for different subjects)
4. Take tests/quizzes
5. Use educational tools such as:
a) Wikipedia search 
b) Wolfram alpha-  for solving equations with or without the steps taken, plotting 2D and 3D graphs
Wolfram alpha also has a smart bot that you can ask general QnAs...
c) Translating between different languages
